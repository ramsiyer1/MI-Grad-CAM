This is the official github repository of the paper **"MI-CAM: Class Agnostic Mutual Information Weighted Activation Mapping for Causal Visual Explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks"**. With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called MI-CAM based on activation mapping. Unlike previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI-CAM produces class agnostic visualisations by weighing each
feature map through its normalized mutual information with the input image, hence eliminating the class-based biases in network explanations and the final result is generated by a linear combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal interpretations.
